### **PROPOSED MODEL: Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network with Differentiable Spectral Clustering (HT-GNN-DSC)**

Let me justify each component with academic support:

---

## **1. BASE ARCHITECTURE: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN)**

### **WHY?**
Your graph has **multiple node types** (buildings, transformers, substations) and **multiple edge types** (electrical, spatial, temporal, complementarity). Standard GNNs assume homogeneous graphs.
