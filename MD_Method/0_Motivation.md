# Problem Definition: Knowledge Graph-Driven Energy Complementarity Analysis for Urban Energy Transition

The energy transition in cities requires fundamental shifts from centralized to decentralized systems, where local energy sharing between prosumers becomes critical for grid stability and renewable integration. Non-Wires Alternatives (NWA) - solutions that defer or eliminate the need for traditional grid infrastructure upgrades - are increasingly important for managing this transition cost-effectively. However, identifying optimal locations and configurations for NWA interventions requires deep understanding of both energy complementarity patterns and physical grid constraints.

This project addresses the challenge of systematically analyzing urban energy systems to identify opportunities for local energy sharing and NWA deployment. The core innovation lies in combining Knowledge Graphs (KG) with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to respect the hierarchical nature of electrical grids while discovering complementary energy patterns.

The approach operates at multiple spatial boundaries:
1. **City/District Level**: Initial area selection based on data availability
2. **LV Network Level**: Primary clustering boundary (cannot share across different LV transformers)
3. **Sub-cluster Level**: Dynamic groupings within LV networks based on complementarity

The methodology follows a structured pipeline:
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Integrate building attributes, grid topology, and energy profiles into a unified semantic model
- **Topology-Aware Area Selection**: Use KG queries to identify feasible study areas with complete data coverage
- **GNN-based Clustering**: Develop dynamic clusters that respect LV boundaries while maximizing energy complementarity
- **NWA Potential Assessment**: Evaluate clusters for peak reduction, self-sufficiency, and infrastructure deferral opportunities
- **Visualization Framework**: Create intuitive maps and dashboards showing cluster evolution and energy flows

Given practical constraints, this implementation focuses on demonstrating the framework at the LV network level, creating complementarity-based sub-clusters, and visualizing temporal dynamics of energy sharing potential. This provides a scalable foundation for future city-wide deployment while delivering immediate insights for targeted NWA interventions.

# Project Definition: Knowledge Graph and GNN-based Framework for ..... to Support Urban Energy Transition

## 1. Problem Statement & Motivation

### 1.1 Context: Urban Energy Transition Challenges

**The Challenge:**
Cities undergoing energy transition face a critical infrastructure problem: the existing low-voltage (LV) distribution networks were designed for unidirectional power flow and predictable consumption patterns. With rapid adoption of:

- Distributed solar PV
- Electric vehicles (EVs)
- Heat pump electrification
- Battery storage systems
- Retrofit buildings

These networks experience:

- **Peak load violations**
- **Voltage instability**
- **Transformer overloading**
- **Grid congestion**

**The Opportunity:**
Local energy sharing through dynamic energy communities can reduce peak loads by 15-30% by matching complementary consumption patterns, potentially deferring grid investments worth millions of euros per district.

### 1.2 Research Gap

### 2.2 Specific Goals

1. **Create a semantic representation** of the urban energy system combining:

   - Building characteristics and energy profiles
   - Electrical grid topology and constraints
   - Spatial relationships and proximity
2. **Design a GNN architecture** that:

   - Respects hard constraints (LV boundaries, transformer capacity)
   - Optimizes for energy complementarity (not similarity)
   - Enables dynamic cluster formation based on temporal patterns
3. **Demonstrate practical value** by:

   - Quantifying peak reduction potential (target: 20-30%)
   - Identifying priority areas for NWA interventions
   - Visualizing energy sharing opportunities

### 2.3 Scope Boundaries

**In Scope:**

- Buildings connected to selected LV networks (100-200 buildings per LV)
- 15-minute resolution energy profiles (electricity, heating, cooling)
- Grid topology at LV and MV levels
- Simulated solar generation and battery storage
- Dynamic clustering at hourly/daily timescales

**Out of Scope:**

- Real-time control systems
- Power flow simulations
- Economic optimization
- Regulatory frameworks
- Hardware implementation

## 3. Methodology Overview

### 3.1 Study Area Selection & Data Integration

**Area Selection Criteria:**

```
1. Data Availability:
   - Complete building footprints and attributes
   - Grid topology (LV lines, transformers)
   - Energy simulation results
   
2. Diversity Metrics:
   - Mix of residential and commercial buildings
   - Variety in building ages and sizes
   - Presence of both dense and sparse areas
   
3. Grid Characteristics:
   - Multiple LV networks under same MV transformer
   - Clear electrical boundaries
```

**Data Layers:**

```
PostgreSQL Database:
├── Building Data (6.2M buildings)
│   ├── Geometry, area, height, age
│   ├── Function (residential/commercial)
│   └── Roof characteristics (solar potential)
├── Grid Infrastructure
│   ├── LV cables and components
│   ├── MV/LV transformers
│   └── Electrical connections
└── Energy Profiles
    ├── EnergyPlus simulations
    ├── 15-min electricity, heating, cooling
    └── Synthetic solar/battery profiles
```

### 3.2 Knowledge Graph Construction

**Purpose:** Create a semantic layer that captures relationships traditional databases miss.

```
Node Types:
├── Building (attributes: type, area, orientation, age)
├── LV_Network (attributes: capacity, connected_buildings)
├── Transformer (attributes: rating, loading)
└── Energy_Profile (attributes: peak_time, base_load)

Relationships:
├── CONNECTED_TO (building → LV_network)
├── SUPPLIED_BY (LV_network → transformer)
├── HAS_PROFILE (building → energy_profile)
├── WITHIN_DISTANCE (building → building)
└── COMPLEMENTS (profile → profile) [learned]
```

### 3.3 GNN-based Dynamic Clustering

**Two-Level Clustering Approach:**

**Level 1: LV Network Clustering**

- Respect hard electrical boundaries
- Each cluster ⊆ single LV network
- Maximum 30-50 buildings per cluster

**Level 2: Sub-clusters for Complementarity**

- Identify 3-5 sub-groups within each LV cluster
- Optimize for anti-correlated load profiles
- Enable peer-to-peer energy sharing

### 3.4 Evaluation Framework

**Technical Metrics:**

```
1. Peak Reduction:
   - Individual: max(building_load)
   - Clustered: max(Σ cluster_loads)
   - Improvement: 1 - (clustered/individual)

2. Self-Sufficiency:
   - Energy produced and consumed locally
   - Reduced grid exchange

3. Constraint Satisfaction:
   - 100% clusters within LV boundaries
   - No transformer overloading
   - Voltage limits maintained
```

**Practical Metrics:**

```
1. NWA Potential:

2. Implementation Feasibility:

```

## 4. Expected Contributions

### 4.1 Scientific Contributions

1. **Novel GNN Architecture for Heterophily**: Unlike standard GNNs that cluster similar nodes, our approach explicitly seeks complementary (dissimilar) profiles
2. **Constraint-Aware Dynamic Pooling**: First application combining:

   - Hard electrical topology constraints
   - Soft spatial proximity preferences
   - Dynamic temporal adaptation
3. **Semantic-Enhanced Energy Analytics**: Demonstrates value of Knowledge Graphs for power system analysis beyond traditional time-series methods

### 4.2 Practical Contributions

1. **NWA Decision Support Tool**: Identifies where local energy communities can defer grid investments
2. **Validated Methodology**: Using real building data and grid topology (not synthetic networks)
3. **Scalable Framework**: From single LV network to district-wide analysis

## 5. Addressing Potential Criticisms

### 5.1 "Why Knowledge Graphs?"

**Criticism:** "This could be done with a regular database"

**Response:** Knowledge Graphs provide:

- Flexible schema for heterogeneous data (buildings + grid + profiles)
- Semantic relationships that enable reasoning (e.g., "all buildings supplied by overloaded transformers")
- Natural graph structure for GNN input
- Extensibility for future data sources

### 5.2 "Why GNNs instead of traditional clustering?"

**Criticism:** "K-means or hierarchical clustering would be simpler"

**Response:** GNNs uniquely enable:

- Clustering that respects network topology (hard constraints)
- Learning from both node features AND relationships
- Dynamic adaptation based on temporal patterns
- End-to-end optimization for complementarity (not similarity)

### 5.3 "Is this practically implementable?"

**Criticism:** "This is too complex for real-world deployment"

**Response:**

- We provide clear implementation pathway with existing technologies
- Computational requirements are reasonable (minutes for 1000s of buildings)
- Results translate directly to actionable recommendations
- Framework designed for utility decision-support, not real-time control

### 5.4 "What about data privacy?"

**Criticism:** "Individual consumption data is sensitive"

**Response:**

- We use simulated energy profiles from building characteristics
- Aggregation at cluster level preserves privacy
- Framework can work with anonymized data
- Focus on patterns, not individual consumption
