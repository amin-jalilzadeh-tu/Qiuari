# Answer 1

## **🏗️ GNN MODEL ARCHITECTURE FOR YOUR PROJECT**

### **1. GRAPH REPRESENTATION FROM YOUR DATA**

#### **Heterogeneous Graph Structure**
Your graph is NOT homogeneous - it has multiple node and edge types from your KG:

**Node Types (3 levels):**
- **Building Nodes** (majority): Individual consumers/prosumers with energy profiles
- **Infrastructure Nodes**: Transformers, junction boxes, substations
- **Virtual Cluster Nodes**: Dynamic groupings that form and dissolve

**Edge Types (4 relationships):**
- **Electrical Edges**: Physical power lines with capacity/impedance attributes
- **Proximity Edges**: Spatial nearness for loss calculations
- **Complementarity Edges**: Learned/discovered anti-correlations (negative weights!)
- **Hierarchy Edges**: Building→Transformer→Substation relationships

#### **Feature Dimensions**
**Node Features from KG (per building):**
- **Static** (15-20 dims): floor_area, building_type, orientation, age, roof_potential
- **Energy Profile** (96-288 dims): compressed 15-min data via autoencoder
- **Temporal** (10 dims): hour, day_of_week, season, holiday indicators
- **Intervention** (5-10 dims): has_solar, battery_capacity, heat_pump_status
- **KG Embeddings** (32-64 dims): learned from KG structure

**Edge Features:**
- **Electrical**: capacity, resistance, voltage_level
- **Temporal**: time-varying correlation matrices
- **Distance**: physical_distance, electrical_distance

### **2. CORE GNN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN**

#### **Multi-Layer Heterogeneous Architecture**

**Layer 1: Feature Encoding**
- **Purpose**: Transform raw KG features into learnable representations
- **Components**: 
  - Linear projections for each node type
  - Positional encoding for grid hierarchy
  - Time encoding for temporal awareness

**Layer 2: Heterophily-Aware Message Passing**
- **Purpose**: Handle complementarity (dissimilar nodes should connect)
- **Architecture Choice**: **FAGCN (Frequency Adaptive GCN)**
  - Separates low-frequency (similarity) and high-frequency (complementarity) signals
  - Perfect for your negative correlation needs
  - Formula: Combines positive and negative propagation paths

**Layer 3: Attention Mechanism**
- **Purpose**: Learn which connections matter most
- **Architecture Choice**: **Heterogeneous GAT**
  - Different attention weights for different edge types
  - Learns that electrical edges > proximity edges for some tasks
  - Time-dependent attention (morning vs evening importance)

**Layer 4: Temporal Dynamics**
- **Purpose**: Capture how patterns evolve over time
- **Architecture Choice**: **TGN (Temporal Graph Network) Memory**
  - Maintains memory of past cluster configurations
  - Updates based on new consumption patterns
  - Enables smooth transitions between time periods

**Layer 5: Hierarchical Pooling**
- **Purpose**: Form clusters while respecting constraints
- **Architecture Choice**: **Constrained DiffPool**
  - Soft cluster assignments (probabilistic membership)
  - Hard constraints via masking (transformer boundaries)
  - Multi-scale: Building→Block→LV Network→District

### **3. SPECIFIC DESIGN FOR YOUR OBJECTIVES**

#### **For Complementarity Learning**

**Signed Message Passing:**
- Positive edges aggregate normally
- Negative edges (complementarity) invert signals
- Balance theory enforcement (if A complements B, and B complements C, then A similar to C)

**Custom Aggregation:**
```
For each node:
- Aggregate similar neighbors (add their features)
- Aggregate complementary neighbors (subtract their features)
- Combine both signals with learned weights
```

#### **For Dynamic Clustering**

**Time-Aware Architecture:**
- **Input**: Current time as node feature
- **Memory**: Past cluster assignments stored
- **Output**: Cluster membership probabilities that change hourly

**Reconfiguration Triggers:**
- Peak hour approaching → tighter clusters
- Weekend pattern → different configuration
- Weather change → adjust solar-rich clusters

#### **For NWA Planning**

**Intervention Impact Layers:**
- **Counterfactual Branch**: What-if this building had solar?
- **Propagation Analysis**: How benefits spread through network
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Where constraints bind first

### **4. LOSS FUNCTION DESIGN**

Your GNN needs multiple objectives balanced:

**Primary Loss Components:**

1. **Complementarity Loss**
   - Minimize within-cluster correlation
   - Maximize anti-correlation benefits
   - Weight by time-of-use importance

2. **Balance Loss**
   - Minimize net energy exchange per cluster
   - Balance generation and consumption
   - Penalize one-sided clusters

3. **Constraint Violation Loss**
   - Infinite penalty for crossing transformer boundaries
   - High penalty for capacity violations
   - Soft penalty for non-compact clusters

4. **Stability Loss**
   - Penalize frequent reconfiguration
   - Reward persistent memberships
   - Balance with adaptation needs

### **5. TRAINING STRATEGY**

#### **Curriculum Learning Approach**

**Stage 1: Learn Basic Patterns**
- Train on single LV networks
- Focus on complementarity discovery
- Ignore complex constraints initially

**Stage 2: Add Constraints**
- Introduce transformer boundaries
- Add capacity limitations
- Learn feasible configurations

**Stage 3: Dynamic Adaptation**
- Train on full temporal sequences
- Learn reconfiguration patterns
- Optimize transition smoothness

**Stage 4: Intervention Planning**
- Add what-if scenarios
- Learn intervention impacts
- Optimize for NWA objectives

#### **Data Flow from KG to GNN**

**Step 1: Query KG for Training Data**
- Extract building features
- Get grid topology
- Retrieve energy profiles
- Fetch constraint specifications

**Step 2: Graph Construction**
- Create node feature matrices
- Build adjacency matrices (one per edge type)
- Generate constraint masks
- Prepare temporal sequences

**Step 3: Training Loop**
- Forward pass through GNN
- Calculate multi-objective loss
- Backpropagate gradients
- Update weights

**Step 4: Results Back to KG**
- Store learned embeddings
- Save cluster assignments
- Record performance metrics
- Update complementarity scores

### **6. MODEL VARIANTS FOR DIFFERENT QUERIES**

#### **Fast Inference Model (Real-time)**
- Shallow architecture (2-3 layers)
- Pre-computed embeddings from KG
- Fixed cluster number
- Response: <1 second

#### **Deep Analysis Model (Planning)**
- Deep architecture (5-7 layers)
- Full feature processing
- Variable cluster numbers
- Response: 10-60 seconds

#### **What-If Scenario Model**
- Counterfactual branches
- Intervention simulation layers
- Impact propagation analysis
- Response: 2-5 minutes

### **7. HANDLING YOUR SPECIFIC CHALLENGES**

#### **No Real Ground Truth**
- **Semi-supervised approach**: Use physics equations as weak supervision
- **Self-supervised tasks**: Predict next hour's consumption, reconstruct masked features
- **Proxy metrics**: Peak reduction, self-sufficiency (measurable without ground truth)

#### **Multi-Scale Requirements**
- **Hierarchical architecture**: Building→Cluster→LV→District layers
- **Cross-scale attention**: How building changes affect district
- **Multi-resolution features**: Fine-grained for buildings, aggregated for districts

#### **Constraint Satisfaction**
- **Hard masking**: Impossible connections have zero weight
- **Soft penalties**: Undesirable but possible configurations penalized
- **Physics-informed layers**: Embed Kirchhoff's laws in architecture

### **8. EXPECTED OUTPUTS**

**Per Building:**
- Cluster membership probabilities (time-varying)
- Intervention priority scores
- Complementarity scores with neighbors
- Role classification (producer/consumer/flexible)

**Per Cluster:**
- Self-sufficiency potential
- Peak reduction capability
- Stability score
- Intervention recommendations

**Per LV Network:**
- Bottleneck identification
- NWA intervention plan
- Electrification capacity
- Grid violation risks

**System Level:**
- District self-sufficiency pathways
- Investment prioritization
- Scenario comparisons
- Performance trajectories

### **9. KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS**

**Why Heterogeneous GNN?**
- Different relationships need different processing
- Electrical edges ≠ proximity edges
- Richer representation learning

**Why Signed Networks?**
- Complementarity = negative correlation
- Need to model repulsion, not just attraction
- Balance theory provides theoretical foundation

**Why Hierarchical Pooling?**
- Natural match to grid hierarchy
- Enforces electrical constraints
- Enables multi-scale analysis

**Why Temporal Memory?**
- Patterns evolve throughout day
- Past configurations inform future
- Smooth transitions important

**Why Multiple Loss Terms?**
- Single objective insufficient
- Real-world has multiple constraints
- Balances competing goals

### **10. THE COMPLETE PIPELINE**

```
KG Data → Feature Extraction → Graph Construction → 
GNN Processing → Cluster Formation → Constraint Check → 
Intervention Planning → KG Update → Query Response
```

**This architecture is specifically designed for YOUR data:**
- Respects your grid topology constraints
- Learns from your energy profiles
- Leverages your KG relationships
- Achieves your complementarity objectives
- Enables your NWA planning goals

The key innovation is combining heterophily-aware learning (for complementarity) with hierarchical constraint satisfaction (for grid feasibility) while maintaining temporal adaptability (for dynamic clustering).1. what about elabels we use   



# Answer 2

## 🏗️ **GNN MODEL ARCHITECTURE Based on YOUR Data**

Let me design the GNN specifically for YOUR data structure and KG!

## 📊 **Step 1: Understanding YOUR Data Layers**

```
YOUR DATA SOURCES:
==================
1. GIS Grid Data → Physical network topology
2. Building Archetypes → Static properties  
3. EnergyPlus Simulations → 15-min energy profiles
4. Neo4j KG → Rich relationships and semantics
5. Weather Data → External factors
```

## 🔧 **Step 2: Graph Construction from YOUR KG**

### **Multi-Relational Graph Structure**

```
NODES (from your Neo4j):
========================
- Building (id, archetype, area, year, equipment)
- Transformer (id, capacity, voltage_level)  
- Cluster (id, timestamp, metrics) [dynamic]
- TimeSlot (hour, season, weekday) [temporal]

EDGES (multiple types):
=======================
1. PHYSICAL_CONNECTION (building → transformer)
2. ELECTRICAL_PROXIMITY (building → building, same LV)
3. TEMPORAL_CORRELATION (building → building, correlation weight)
4. SHARES_TRANSFORMER (building → building)
5. COMPLEMENTARY_PATTERN (building → building, negative correlation)
```

## 🎯 **Step 3: YOUR GNN Model Architecture**

### **Heterogeneous Temporal GNN Design**

```python
YOUR GNN STRUCTURE:
===================

INPUT LAYER (Your Features)
----------------------------
Node Features (from KG + EnergyPlus):
- Static: [archetype_embedding, area, year, has_solar, has_battery]
- Dynamic: [last_24h_consumption, peak_time, base_load, variance]
- Temporal: [hour_of_day, day_of_week, season]
- Spatial: [x_coord, y_coord, transformer_id]

Edge Features:
- Physical: [distance, cable_capacity, voltage_drop]
- Temporal: [correlation_15min, correlation_daily, correlation_weekly]
- Semantic: [same_archetype, compatible_equipment]

LAYER 1: Multi-Relational Message Passing
------------------------------------------
# Different neural networks for different edge types
PHYSICAL_EDGES → GCN (preserve grid topology)
CORRELATION_EDGES → FAGCN (handle negative correlations)  
SEMANTIC_EDGES → GAT (attention on similar contexts)

# Aggregate messages
h1 = α₁*h_physical + α₂*h_correlation + α₃*h_semantic

LAYER 2: Temporal Dynamics
---------------------------
# Your 15-min data needs temporal processing
Input: Sequence of node states [t-96, ..., t] (24 hours)
Process: GRU/LSTM or Temporal Attention
Output: Temporal-aware embeddings

LAYER 3: Hierarchical Pooling
------------------------------
# Respect your grid hierarchy
Building → LV Network → MV Feeder → District
Use: ConstrainedDiffPool with voltage boundaries

OUTPUT HEADS (Your Tasks)
--------------------------
1. Complementarity Score: σ(W₁h) → [0,1]
2. Cluster Assignment: softmax(W₂h) → probabilities
3. Intervention Priority: W₃h → ranking score
4. Energy Sharing Potential: W₄h → kW tradeable
```

## 🔄 **Step 4: Feature Engineering from YOUR Data**

### **From EnergyPlus Simulations**
```python
TEMPORAL FEATURES (per building):
==================================
- load_profile_15min → [96 values per day]
- daily_peak_time → scalar [0-23]
- ramp_rate → max(load[t] - load[t-1])
- load_factor → average/peak
- time_above_base → hours > baseline
```

### **From KG Relationships**
```python
GRAPH FEATURES:
===============
- degree_centrality → how connected
- clustering_coefficient → local density
- betweenness → critical path position
- pagerank → importance in network
- k_core → resilience indicator
```

### **From Grid Topology**
```python
ELECTRICAL FEATURES:
====================
- distance_to_transformer → meters
- voltage_level → LV/MV encoding
- phase_connection → 1,2,3 or three-phase
- max_capacity → kW limit
- impedance_path → electrical resistance
```

## 🎨 **Step 5: Message Passing for YOUR Use Case**

### **Heterophilic Message Passing (Key for Complementarity)**

```python
STANDARD GNN (won't work for you):
h_i = σ(W_self*h_i + Σ W_neighbor*h_j)
      → Assumes similar neighbors good

YOUR HETEROPHILIC GNN:
h_i = σ(W_self*h_i + 
        Σ correlation[i,j] * W_neg*h_j)  # correlation can be negative!
      → Negative correlation = stronger message
```

### **Multi-Relational Aggregation**

```python
For each building node i:
========================
# Physical neighbors (same transformer)
h_physical = mean([h_j for j in physical_neighbors])

# Complementary neighbors (negative correlation)  
h_complement = mean([h_j * -corr[i,j] for j if corr[i,j] < -0.3])

# Similar neighbors (for context)
h_similar = mean([h_j for j if same_archetype])

# Combine with learned weights
h_i_new = MLP([h_i, h_physical, h_complement, h_similar])
```

## 📐 **Step 6: Loss Functions for YOUR Objectives**

```python
MULTI-TASK LOSS:
================

1. COMPLEMENTARITY LOSS (main objective)
L_comp = -mean(correlation[i,j]) for i,j in same_cluster
         → Minimize correlation within clusters

2. PEAK REDUCTION LOSS
L_peak = PAR_after_clustering / PAR_before
         → Minimize peak-to-average ratio

3. SELF-SUFFICIENCY LOSS  
L_self = -sum(local_generation_used) / sum(total_consumption)
         → Maximize local energy usage

4. CONSTRAINT VIOLATION LOSS
L_const = penalty * num_cross_voltage_connections
          → Prevent invalid clusters

5. STABILITY LOSS
L_stable = sum(cluster_changes_per_hour)
           → Prevent excessive cluster switching

TOTAL = λ₁L_comp + λ₂L_peak + λ₃L_self + λ₄L_const + λ₅L_stable
```

## 🔮 **Step 7: YOUR Specific Model Configuration**

```python
RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE FOR YOUR CASE:
========================================

Base Model: HeteroGNN (handles multiple edge types)
Temporal: TGN memory (tracks building states)
Pooling: DiffPool (soft clustering)

- Hidden dimensions: 128
- Temporal window: 96 timesteps (24 hours)
- Number of clusters: 10-20 per LV network

```

## 💡 **Step 8: Training Strategy for YOUR Data**

```python
TRAINING APPROACH:
==================

1. SUPERVISED SIGNALS (you can create):
- Complementarity labels from correlation analysis
- Peak events from historical data
- Successful trading pairs from simulation

2. SELF-SUPERVISED SIGNALS:

- Next-timestep prediction

3. CURRICULUM LEARNING:
Week 1-2: Learn individual building patterns
Week 3-4: Learn pairwise complementarity
Week 5-6: Learn cluster formation
Week 7-8: Add constraints and multi-task
```

## 🎯 **What Makes YOUR Model Special**

```
YOUR UNIQUE ASPECTS:
====================
1. Negative correlations as PRIMARY signal (not secondary)
2. Hard electrical constraints embedded in architecture
3. Multi-resolution temporal (15-min + daily + seasonal)
4. Hierarchical pooling matching grid topology
5. Multi-task outputs (cluster + intervene + share)
```

## 📊 **Expected Outputs from YOUR GNN**

```python
For each 15-minute interval:
=============================
1. Cluster assignments (soft probabilities)
2. Building compatibility matrix
3. Intervention priorities ranked list
4. Energy sharing potential matrix

```

## 🎨 **EXPLOITING Your Multi-Label Structure**

### **Intervention-Aware Message Passing**

```python
SPECIALIZED MESSAGE PASSING FOR YOUR LABELS:

1. HEATING SYSTEM MESSAGES:
   "Buildings with gas_boiler learn from successful heat_pump converts"
   h_heat = aggregate(neighbors WHERE successful_heat_pump_retrofit)

2. COOLING OPTIMIZATION MESSAGES:
   "Buildings learn cooling strategies from similar climate exposure"
   h_cool = aggregate(neighbors WITH similar_solar_orientation AND has_efficient_cooling)

3. ELECTRIFICATION PATHWAY MESSAGES:

```

## 🔄 **Label-Specific Learning Tasks**

### **Multi-Task Heads for YOUR Labels**

```

## 📐 **Adjacency-Specific Graph Convolutions**

### **Multi-Adjacency Fusion**

```python
EXPLOIT MULTIPLE ADJACENCIES:

# Different convolution for each adjacency type
conv1 = GraphConv(A_physical) → h_physical
conv2 = GraphConv(A_spatial) → h_spatial  
conv3 = SignedConv(A_correlation) → h_complement
conv4 = GraphConv(A_transformer) → h_electrical

# Attention mechanism to weight importance
α = learned_attention([h_physical, h_spatial, h_complement, h_electrical])
h_fused = Σ α[i] * h[i]

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Physical adjacency → energy can actually flow
- Spatial adjacency → similar weather exposure
- Correlation adjacency → complementarity patterns
- Transformer adjacency → shared infrastructure constraints
```

## 🎯 **Label-Aware Clustering**

### **Intervention-Compatible Clusters**

```python
CLUSTERING THAT CONSIDERS YOUR LABELS:

OBJECTIVE: Create clusters that are:
1. Complementary in energy use
2. Compatible for joint interventions
3. Similar enough for bulk procurement

EXAMPLE CLUSTER:
Cluster_A = {
  Building_1: gas_heating, morning_peak, solar_ready
  Building_2: heat_pump, evening_peak, battery_installed
  Building_3: electric_heat, night_peak, EV_charger
}

WHY IT WORKS:
- Different peak times (complementary)
- All moving toward electrification (compatible)
- Can share solar+battery resources (synergistic)
```

## 💡 **Loss Functions Using YOUR Labels**

```python
LABEL-SPECIFIC LOSSES:

1. INTERVENTION COMPATIBILITY LOSS:
L_intervention = penalty if cluster has mixed intervention needs
Example: Don't cluster gas_heating with fully_electric if retrofit planned

2. ELECTRIFICATION PATHWAY LOSS:
L_pathway = reward clusters at similar electrification stages
Example: Buildings at stage 2 cluster together for joint upgrades

3. SYSTEM DIVERSITY LOSS:
L_diversity = reward clusters with diverse heating/cooling patterns
Example: Heat_pump(morning) + Gas(evening) = good diversity

4. LABEL CONSISTENCY LOSS:
L_label = ensure predictions respect your labels
Example: Can't recommend heat_pump if labeled "not_feasible"
```

## 🔮 **Specific Queries Using YOUR Labels**

```cypher
// Find best heat pump candidates in complementary clusters
MATCH (b:Building {heating: 'gas_boiler'})-[:IN_CLUSTER]->(c:Cluster)
WHERE c.complementarity_score > 0.7
AND b.heat_pump_ready = true
RETURN b.id, c.id, b.expected_savings

// Find clusters ready for joint electrification
MATCH (c:Cluster)<-[:IN_CLUSTER]-(b:Building)
WITH c, avg(b.electrification_stage) as avg_stage,
     collect(DISTINCT b.heating) as heating_types
WHERE avg_stage > 0.5 AND size(heating_types) <= 2
RETURN c.id, heating_types, count(b) as building_count

// Identify cooling intervention opportunities
MATCH (b:Building {cooling: 'no_cooling'})-[:NEAR]->(b2:Building {cooling: 'efficient_ac'})
WHERE b.cooling_hours > 500
RETURN b.id, b2.id, b.cooling_potential
```

## 📊 **Feature Importance from YOUR Data**

```python
MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES TO EXPLOIT:

1. CROSS-LABEL INTERACTIONS:
   heating_type × peak_time → determines complementarity
   cooling_need × solar_potential → determines self-sufficiency
   electrification_stage × grid_capacity → determines feasibility

2. ADJACENCY COMBINATIONS:
   A_physical ∩ A_correlation → feasible complementary pairs
   A_spatial ∩ A_intervention → neighborhood upgrade programs
   A_transformer ∩ heating_labels → load balancing potential

3. TEMPORAL + LABEL:
   heating_profile + heating_type → predict retrofit impact
   cooling_profile + building_age → estimate upgrade potential
```

## 🎯 **What This Enables**

```
WITH YOUR LABELS + ADJACENCIES:
================================

1. INTERVENTION PLANNING:
   "Buildings with gas_heating on Transformer_5 should convert together"

2. COMPLEMENTARITY WITH CONTEXT:
   "Heat_pump buildings complement gas_heating during transition"

3. STAGED ELECTRIFICATION:
   "Track neighborhood's journey from gas to full electric"

4. SYSTEM-AWARE CLUSTERING:
   "Don't cluster incompatible heating systems unless retrofit planned"

5. BULK PROCUREMENT:
   "15 buildings ready for heat pumps in same area"
```

Does this better capture how to exploit YOUR specific data elements - the adjacencies and labels you actually have?











## answer 2




## **🎯 EXPLOITING YOUR SPECIFIC DATA ASSETS IN GNN DESIGN**

### **1. ENERGY LABELS (A-G) - CRITICAL EXPLOITATION**

#### **How to Exploit in GNN:**

**As Node Features:**
- **Direct encoding**: One-hot encode A-G labels (7 dimensions)
- **Ordinal encoding**: A=7, B=6... G=1 (captures quality gradient)
- **Derived features**: Label → expected_consumption_factor, retrofit_priority

**As Edge Weights:**
- Buildings with poor labels (E,F,G) get **stronger edges** to solar-rich buildings
- Create "intervention affinity" edges based on label complementarity

**In Loss Function:**
```
Priority_Loss = weight_by_label * intervention_impact
- Poor labels (F,G) → higher weight for electrification
- Good labels (A,B) → lower priority for retrofit
```

**Strategic Use:**
- **Cluster Formation**: Group poor-label buildings with excess renewable producers
- **Intervention Planning**: Target G→D upgrades before electrification
- **Fairness Constraint**: Ensure each cluster has mix of labels

#### **Specific GNN Layer Design:**
```
Label-Aware Message Passing:
- If neighbor has better label: learn efficiency patterns
- If neighbor has worse label: learn support potential
- Create "energy equity" clusters
```

### **2. ADJACENCY/PROXIMITY - SPATIAL EXPLOITATION**

#### **Multi-Scale Adjacency Edges:**

**Physical Adjacency (from your data):**
- **Direct neighbors**: Share walls → heat transfer modeling
- **Within 50m**: Potential for shared infrastructure
- **Within 200m**: Same microclimate, similar patterns
- **Within LV network**: Electrical proximity matters more

**Edge Feature Engineering:**
```
Adjacency_Features = {
    'euclidean_distance': direct distance
    'manhattan_distance': street routing
    'shared_wall_length': for terraced houses
    'orientation_difference': |orientation_A - orientation_B|
    'height_difference': shading effects
}
```

**Spatial Attention Mechanism:**
```
Attention_weight = f(1/distance) * electrical_connectivity
- Nearby + same transformer = high weight
- Far + different transformer = zero weight
```

### **3. HEATING & COOLING DEMANDS - MULTI-VECTOR EXPLOITATION**

#### **Triple-Stream Architecture:**

**Separate Processing Streams:**
```
Stream 1: Electricity-only buildings
Stream 2: Heating-dominant buildings  
Stream 3: Cooling-dominant buildings

Then: Cross-stream attention for complementarity
```

**Temporal Patterns:**
```
Heating_Pattern_Features:
- morning_ramp_rate (6-8am heating spike)
- evening_duration (5-10pm heating period)
- weather_sensitivity (correlation with temperature)

Cooling_Pattern_Features:
- noon_peak_magnitude
- duration_above_threshold
- solar_correlation (cooling when solar peaks!)
```

**Electrification Impact Layers:**
```
For each building:
1. Current: gas_heating → zero electrical impact
2. Electrified: heating_demand/COP → huge electrical impact
3. GNN learns: which buildings can electrify without breaking grid
```

### **4. ELECTRIFICATION POTENTIAL - TRANSFORMATION MODELING**

#### **Multi-Stage Graph Evolution:**

**Stage 1: Current State Graph**
- Edges weighted by current complementarity
- Features include current heating systems

**Stage 2: Partial Electrification Graph**
- 30% buildings electrified (GNN selects which)
- Update edge weights based on new loads
- Learn cascade effects

**Stage 3: Full Electrification Graph**
- All feasible buildings electrified
- Identify required grid reinforcements
- Plan battery/solar to compensate

**Counterfactual Branches:**
```
For each building, model:
- AS-IS: current state
- TO-BE: with heat pump
- COULD-BE: with heat pump + solar + battery
```

### **5. BUILDING ORIENTATION - SOLAR SYNERGY**

#### **Orientation-Aware Clustering:**

```
Solar Complementarity:
- East-facing: morning generation
- South-facing: noon peak
- West-facing: afternoon generation
- North/Flat: consumption-only

GNN learns: East+West buildings = all-day generation
            South+Storage = noon storage, evening use
```

**Edge Creation Rules:**
```
if building_A.orientation == 'South' and building_B.peak == 'evening':
    create_edge(A, B, type='solar_consumer_pair')
```

### **6. BUILDING AGE & TYPE - RETROFIT PATHWAYS**

#### **Age-Based Features:**

```
Age_Derived_Features:
- insulation_quality (age → U-values)
- retrofit_cost (older → more expensive)
- heritage_constraint (pre-1945 → limited options)
- electrification_readiness (newer → easier)
```

**Type-Based Complementarity:**
```
Residential + Office = natural complements
School + Evening_retail = temporal complement
Hospital + Solar_farm = critical + supplier
```

### **6. ROOF CHARACTERISTICS - DEPLOYMENT POTENTIAL**

#### **Roof-Aware Node Features:**

```
Roof_Potential_Vector:
- flat_area_m2 (best for solar)
- south_facing_sloped_m2 (good for solar)
- other_sloped_m2 (poor for solar)
- structural_capacity (can handle panels?)
- shading_factor (from taller neighbors)
```

**Intervention Readiness Score:**
```
Solar_Readiness = f(roof_area, orientation, shading, grid_capacity)
Battery_Readiness = f(solar_readiness, evening_demand, space_available)
```

### **7. CURRENT ASSETS (Has Solar/Battery/HP)**

#### **Asset-Aware Message Passing:**

```
if neighbor.has_solar and not self.has_solar:
    learn_benefit = potential_energy_sharing
    
if self.has_battery and neighbor.has_solar:
    create_strong_edge (storage-generation pair)
    
if both.have_heat_pump:
    learn_coordination = avoid_simultaneous_peaks
```

### **8. GRID CONNECTION CAPACITY**

#### **Capacity-Constrained Pooling:**

```
Cluster_Capacity_Check:
Sum(building_capacities) vs Transformer_capacity

if approaching_limit:
    - Split cluster
    - Prioritize efficiency upgrades
    - Plan capacity increase
```

### **9. INTEGRATED MULTI-FEATURE EXPLOITATION**

#### **Complete Feature Vector per Building:**

```python
Static_Features = [
    # From your data
    area, height, age_encoded,
    orientation_encoded, type_encoded,
    energy_label_ordinal,
    
    # Derived
    insulation_score, retrofit_priority,
    solar_potential, battery_readiness,
    electrification_feasibility
]

Dynamic_Features = [
    # Per timestep
    electricity_demand, heating_demand, cooling_demand,
    solar_generation_if_exists,
    
    # Computed
    net_demand, ramp_rate,
    correlation_with_temperature
]

Intervention_Features = [
    # Current state
    has_solar, has_battery, has_heat_pump,
    
    # Potential
    solar_capacity_possible,
    battery_size_recommended,
    heat_pump_cop_expected
]
```

### **10. LOSS FUNCTION EXPLOITING ALL DATA**

```python
Total_Loss = (
    # Complementarity (using profiles)
    w1 * minimize_correlation(heating_profiles, cooling_profiles) +
    
    # Equity (using labels)
    w2 * ensure_mixed_labels_per_cluster() +
    
    # Spatial (using adjacency)
    w3 * prefer_proximate_clusters() +
    
    # Feasibility (using grid capacity)
    w4 * respect_transformer_limits() +
    
    # Electrification (using potential)
    w5 * maximize_electrification_ready_clusters() +
    
    # Solar optimization (using roof + orientation)
    w6 * pair_solar_potential_with_demand()
)
```

### **12. QUERIES EXPLOITING YOUR SPECIFIC DATA**

```cypher
// Using energy labels
"Which F/G label buildings should get priority upgrades?"

// Using heating data
"Which gas-heated buildings are ready for heat pumps?"

// Using proximity
"Which adjacent buildings could share a community battery?"

// Using orientation
"How to pair east/west facing roofs for all-day solar?"

// Using cooling demand
"Which buildings need cooling support during heatwaves?"

// Combined
"Find clusters that improve poor-label buildings using 
 nearby solar potential while preparing for electrification"
```

### **THE KEY INSIGHT**

**Your data is incredibly rich** - you have:
- **Energy characteristics** (labels, demands)
- **Physical properties** (orientation, adjacency)
- **Intervention potential** (roofs, electrification readiness)
- **Temporal patterns** (heating/cooling cycles)

The GNN should **exploit ALL of these simultaneously** through:
1. **Multi-stream processing** for different energy vectors
2. **Hierarchical attention** for spatial + electrical relationships
3. **Temporal modeling** for daily/seasonal patterns
4. **Counterfactual reasoning** for intervention planning

This isn't just clustering - it's **learning the optimal transformation pathway** for your entire district using every piece of data you have!
