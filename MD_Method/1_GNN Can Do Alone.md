## **üìä COMBINED GNN + KG CAPABILITIES**

### **9. CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS**

**What They Do Together:**
- GNN provides predictions, KG provides context
- GNN finds patterns, KG explains why
- GNN identifies opportunities, KG provides constraints
- GNN generates embeddings, KG stores them
- GNN discovers relationships, KG persists them

**Questions They Answer Together:**
- "Why did GNN select these buildings?" (GNN clusters + KG attributes)
- "What's preventing this cluster from forming?" (GNN desire + KG constraints)
- "How has complementarity evolved over time?" (GNN patterns + KG history)
- "Which past interventions worked best?" (GNN evaluation + KG records)
- "What patterns repeat across districts?" (GNN learning + KG comparison)

### **10. SCENARIO EVALUATION**

**What They Do Together:**
- KG provides scenarios, GNN evaluates impacts
- KG stores constraints, GNN respects them
- KG tracks changes, GNN predicts outcomes
- KG provides costs, GNN assesses benefits

**Questions They Answer Together:**
- "What's the best electrification pathway?" (KG options + GNN impacts)
- "How do different intervention budgets compare?" (KG costs + GNN benefits)
- "Which scenario achieves 70% self-sufficiency?" (KG targets + GNN prediction)
- "What's the cheapest way to avoid grid upgrades?" (KG prices + GNN solutions)

## **üéØ KEY INSIGHTS: What Makes GNN Unique**

### **Network Effects Understanding**
Unlike statistical methods, GNN understands how effects propagate through the network. A change at Building A affects Building B differently than Building C based on their network relationship, not just distance.

### **Multi-Scale Pattern Recognition**
GNN simultaneously learns patterns at building level, cluster level, LV network level, and district level. It understands how local changes affect global behavior.

### **Temporal-Spatial Dynamics**
GNN captures both spatial relationships (grid topology) and temporal dynamics (consumption patterns), understanding how they interact and evolve.

### **Constraint-Aware Predictions**
Every GNN prediction inherently respects the network structure and constraints. It won't predict impossible configurations.

### **Emergent Behavior Discovery**
GNN can discover emergent patterns that aren't obvious from individual building data - like how certain building combinations create unexpected synergies.

## **üîç The Bottom Line**

**GNN is not just a clustering algorithm.** It's a:
- **Pattern discovery engine** that finds hidden relationships
- **Impact predictor** that traces network effects
- **Scenario evaluator** that respects all constraints
- **Anomaly detector** that identifies problems early
- **Relationship learner** that understands dependencies

**The unique value:** GNN answers questions about **network behavior** that no other method can answer because it fundamentally understands that energy systems are **graphs**, not just collections of independent nodes.
