## ðŸŽ¯ **Framework: Self-Sufficient Energy Communities with NWA Planning**

### **PROJECT TITLE**

**"Graph Neural Network-Based Non-Wire Alternative Planning for Self-Sufficient Energy Communities Under Electrification Scenarios"**

## **1. PROBLEM DEFINITION**

### **Current Challenge**

The energy transition faces three converging crises:

- **Grid congestion** from distributed renewable energy growth
- **Electrification pressure** from heat pumps and EVs (2-3x demand increase)
- **Infrastructure costs** where grid upgrades cost â‚¬1-2M per km

### **Traditional Approach vs Your Solution**

**Traditional:** Upgrade transformers and cables (expensive, slow, disruptive)

**Your NWA Approach:** Create self-sufficient energy communities through strategic placement of solar, batteries, and demand response to avoid grid upgrades while preparing for electrification

## **2. DATA FOUNDATION**

### **Your Available Data (MIMIC Dataset)**

- **6 LV networks** representing typical European configurations
- **Building-level data:** 15-minute consumption profiles, building types, floor areas
- **Grid topology:** Transformer connections, LV network boundaries
- **Temporal coverage:** Multiple months of historical data
- **Synthetic additions:** PV generation profiles, battery operations

### **Data Enrichment Pipeline**

Starting with MIMIC data, the system enriches it through:

- **UBEM simulation** for missing building energy profiles
- **GIS extraction** for building geometries and orientations
- **Electrification scenarios** projecting heat pump and EV adoption
- **Grid constraints** from DSO specifications

## **3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Three-Layer Architecture**

#### **Layer 1: Knowledge Graph (Persistent Storage)**

The KG serves as the central repository storing:

- **Static data:** Building attributes, grid topology, intervention costs
- **Dynamic data:** Load profiles, cluster assignments over time
- **Learned data:** GNN embeddings, intervention impacts, performance metrics
- **Relationships:** Electrical connections, spatial proximity, temporal patterns

#### **Layer 2: GNN Engine (Intelligence Layer)**

The GNN provides:

- **Pattern learning** from historical data
- **Impact prediction** for interventions
- **Network effect modeling** through graph propagation
- **Constraint satisfaction** through architecture design

#### **Layer 3: Query Interface (User Interaction)**

Enables users to ask strategic and operational questions through natural language or structured queries

## **4. CORE FUNCTIONALITIES**

### **4.1 Dynamic Community Formation**

**Objective:** Create time-varying energy communities that maximize self-sufficiency

**Process:**

- Identify complementary consumption patterns (negative correlations)
- Respect grid constraints (transformer boundaries)
- Allow dynamic membership (buildings can switch communities based on time of day)
- Optimize for multiple objectives (self-sufficiency, PAR reduction, stability)

**Output:** Time-dependent community configurations with performance metrics

### **4.2 Non-Wire Alternative Planning**

**Objective:** Avoid expensive grid upgrades through strategic DER placement

**Process:**

- Identify grid bottlenecks (overloaded transformers, voltage violations)
- Evaluate intervention options (solar, battery, demand response)
- Assess network-wide impact of each intervention
- Optimize intervention portfolio within budget constraints

**Output:** Ranked intervention plan with cost-benefit analysis

### **4.3 Electrification Readiness Assessment**

**Objective:** Determine grid capacity for heat pumps and EV chargers

**Scenarios Evaluated:**

- Baseline (current state)
- With 30% heat pump adoption
- With 50% EV adoption
- Combined electrification
- With NWA interventions

**Output:** Capacity assessment and required interventions for each scenario

## **5. QUERY SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Query Types and Processing**

#### **Type A: Direct KG Queries (No GNN Needed)**

These queries retrieve stored information:

- "What is the current community configuration?"
- "Which buildings have solar panels?"
- "What was yesterday's self-sufficiency rate?"
- "Show transformer loading over past week"

**Processing:** Direct CYPHER queries to Neo4j
**Speed:** Milliseconds
**When to use:** Historical data, current state, stored results

#### **Type B: Cached GNN Results (Pre-computed)**

These queries use previously computed GNN outputs:

- "Show the optimal solar locations" (if already computed)
- "What are the predicted clusters for tomorrow?" (if already predicted)
- "Display intervention rankings" (if already evaluated)

**Processing:** KG query for stored GNN results
**Speed:** Milliseconds to seconds
**When to use:** Recently computed predictions, standard scenarios

#### **Type C: Fresh GNN Execution (Real-time Computation)**

These queries require new GNN forward passes:

- "What if we add 50kW battery to Building 23?"
- "How would 70% heat pump adoption affect the grid?"
- "Optimize for 90% self-sufficiency"
- "Find NWA plan for new budget constraint"

**Processing:** Load data from KG â†’ Run GNN â†’ Store results â†’ Return answer
**Speed:** 10-60 seconds
**When to use:** Novel scenarios, what-if analysis, custom optimization

### **Query Decision Logic**

The system automatically determines query type:

1. Check if answer exists in KG (Type A)
2. Check if recent GNN results apply (Type B)
3. If neither, execute fresh GNN run (Type C)
