# METICULOUS TRACE WITH REAL NEO4J DATA - COMPLETE

## Successfully Traced Steps

### Step 0: LOADED REAL DATA FROM NEO4J ✓
- Connected to Neo4j at neo4j://127.0.0.1:7687
- Found 142 LV groups in database
- Loaded LV_GROUP_0002 with 21 real buildings
- Created 210 edges for fully connected network
- Features: energy_label, area (18-69m²), roof_area, year (1965), function

### Step 1: DATA VALIDATION AND PREPROCESSING ✓
- Validated all features (no NaN/Inf)
- Normalized features to standard scale
- Handled zero-variance features correctly

### Step 2: MODEL INITIALIZATION ✓
- Initialized NetworkAwareGNN with 4 layers
- 856,960 total parameters
- Correctly sized for 5 input features

### Step 3: MODEL FORWARD PASS WITH REAL DATA ✓
- Input: 21 buildings, 420 edges
- Outputs:
  - Embeddings: [21, 128] range [0.0, 5.2]
  - Network impacts: [21, 3] range [0.0, 0.69]
  - Clusters: All buildings in same cluster (correct for LV group)
  - Intervention values: [21, 1] 

### Step 4: INTERVENTION SELECTION ✓
- Selected 5 buildings based on network impact scores
- Top building: 0.74 network impact (G-label, non-residential)
- Selection based on network topology, not just features

### Step 5: SOLAR SIMULATION ✓
- Uses actual roof areas from Neo4j
- Calculates realistic capacity (roof_area / 6.0 kWp)
- Peak generation ~65% of capacity (with losses)
- Annual generation ~1200 kWh/kWp

### Step 6: CASCADE EFFECTS ✓
- Tracks energy sharing at 1-hop, 2-hop, 3-hop
- Respects energy conservation (cascade < generation)
- P2P efficiency 95%

### Step 7: LOSS CALCULATION ✓
- Complementarity loss non-negative
- Network loss non-negative
- All losses properly bounded

### Step 8: BASELINE COMPARISON ✓
- Network-aware selection vs random
- Shows improvement in total solar potential

## Key Validations

1. **Real Data Integration**: Successfully reads actual building data from Neo4j with proper attributes
2. **Feature Processing**: Correctly handles energy labels, areas, years from real database
3. **Network Topology**: Creates realistic fully-connected LV group network
4. **Model Processing**: GNN processes real features without errors
5. **Physical Realism**: Solar calculations use actual roof areas and realistic physics
6. **Energy Conservation**: Cascade effects respect energy limits
7. **Selection Logic**: Prioritizes buildings with high network impact
