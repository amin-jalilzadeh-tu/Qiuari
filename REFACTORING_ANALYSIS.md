## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Merge Duplicates
1. **Base GNN**: Merge optimized_base_gnn.py optimizations into base_gnn.py
2. **Temporal**: Merge temporal_layers.py into enhanced_temporal_layers.py
3. **Uncertainty**: Merge uncertainty_quantification.py into enhanced_uncertainty.py
4. **Training**: Merge network_aware_trainer.py features into unified_gnn_trainer.py
5. **Losses**: Merge network_aware_loss.py into loss_functions.py

### Phase 2: Simplify Complex Files
1. **Attention**: Keep only ComplementarityAttention and UnifiedAttentionModule
2. **Network Layers**: Focus on MultiHopAggregator and InterventionImpactLayer
3. **Task Heads**: Keep only essential clustering and prediction heads
4. **Evaluation**: Streamline to core metrics without extensive reporting

### Phase 3: Optional Components
Keep these only if specific functionality is needed:
- **Explainability**: For model interpretation
- **Semi-supervised**: For limited labeled data scenarios
- **Active Learning**: For iterative training
- **Contrastive Learning**: For representation learning
- **Dynamic Graphs**: For time-varying networks

## Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: From 16 model files to 8-10 core files
2. **Eliminated Duplicates**: Remove ~2000 lines of redundant code
3. **Clear Architecture**: Single source of truth for each component
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
5. **Performance**: Remove unnecessary complexity and overhead

- uncertainty_quantification.py (merged)
- enhanced_trainer.py (merged)
- enhanced_trainer_minimal.py (redundant)
- network_aware_trainer.py (merged)
- network_aware_loss.py (merged)

## Estimated Line Reduction

- **Before**: ~15,000 lines across all directories
- **After**: ~10,000 lines with merged functionality
- **Reduction**: ~33% fewer lines while maintaining all essential functionality
