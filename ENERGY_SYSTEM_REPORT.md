## 1. Data Journey: From Raw Sources to Intelligence

### 1.1 Raw Data Sources

The system begins with three primary data sources stored in a Neo4j graph database:

#### Building Data
- **Physical Attributes**: Floor area (18-200m²), roof area, building type, construction year
- **Energy Performance**: Labels (A through G), similar to appliance efficiency ratings
- **Location Data**: Addresses, GPS coordinates, neighborhood groupings
- **Usage Patterns**: Historical hourly consumption data spanning multiple years

#### Electrical Infrastructure
- **Grid Topology**: Low voltage (LV) network connections
- **Transformer Data**: Capacity limits, connection points, operational constraints
- **Network Hierarchy**: Building → LV Line → Transformer → Medium Voltage Grid
- **Constraint Information**: Maximum power flows, voltage tolerances

#### Energy Profiles
- **Temporal Patterns**: 8,760 hourly values per year per building
- **Consumption Profiles**: Residential, commercial, industrial patterns
- **Generation Data**: Solar production where applicable
- **Peak Demand**: Maximum power draw periods and seasonal variations

### 1.2 Data Retrieval Process

The system connects to Neo4j using Cypher queries that:
1. Retrieve all buildings within specified LV groups
2. Fetch associated energy profiles and metadata
3. Map electrical connections and transformer relationships
4. Calculate derived metrics (e.g., energy density = consumption/area)

**Example Scale**: A typical LV group contains 20-50 buildings, sharing 1-3 transformers, with total annual consumption of 500-2000 MWh.

## 2. Data Transformation Pipeline

### 2.1 Feature Engineering (Step 1)

Raw data undergoes systematic transformation:

#### Numerical Standardization
- **Floor Area**: 50m² → 0.25 (normalized to 0-1 scale)
- **Energy Demand**: 5000 kWh/year → 0.4 (based on neighborhood distribution)
- **Roof Area**: 30m² → 0.3 (potential solar capacity indicator)

#### Categorical Encoding
- **Building Type**: "Residential" → [1, 0, 0] (one-hot encoding)
- **Energy Label**: "C" → 0.57 (ordinal encoding, A=1.0, G=0.14)
- **Transformer ID**: "TR_001" → Node embedding index

#### Temporal Feature Extraction
- **Peak Hours**: Identify top 5% consumption periods
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Winter/Summer consumption ratios
- **Daily Profiles**: Morning/Evening peak characteristics
- **Complementarity Scores**: How well consumption patterns offset each other

### 2.2 Graph Construction (Step 2)

The system builds a multi-layer network representation:

#### Physical Proximity Layer
- Buildings within 100m are connected
- Edge weights based on inverse distance
- Captures thermal interaction potential

#### Electrical Network Layer
- Direct connections through same transformer
- Multi-hop paths through grid infrastructure
- Edge weights represent electrical impedance

#### Energy Flow Layer
- Potential energy sharing connections
- Weighted by complementarity scores
- Respects grid topology constraints

**Graph Statistics**:
- Nodes: ~1,000 buildings
- Edges: ~5,000 connections
- Average degree: 5 connections per building
- Diameter: 6-8 hops maximum

### 2.3 Initial Embeddings (Step 3)

Each building receives a 128-dimensional initial representation:

```
Building Vector Components:
[0-31]:   Physical features (area, type, age)
[32-63]:  Energy patterns (consumption, peaks)
[64-95]:  Network position (centrality, clustering)
[96-127]: Temporal features (seasonal, daily patterns)
```

These embeddings capture the complete "energy fingerprint" of each building.
