# Comprehensive Guide to Energy Labels and Building Retrofit in the Netherlands

## Part 1: Energy Label Classification System

### Overview of Energy Labels

Energy labels in the Netherlands are graded from A (energy efficient) to G (energy inefficient) (Homeup, n.d.). The classification system has evolved to include subcategories for highly efficient buildings:

**High Efficiency Labels:**
- **A++++ to A**: Houses with energy label A are very energy efficient, featuring excellent insulation and smart energy systems like solar panels, heat pumps, or efficient hot water installations (Homeup, n.d.).
- **A++++**: These are top performers - often net-zero homes that generate as much energy as they consume
- **A+++**: Houses that are almost energy neutral, using less than 50 kWh per square meter per year
- **A++**: Energy consumption between 50 and 75 kWh per square meter
- **A+**: Property energy consumption between 75 and 105 kWh per square meter per year

**Lower Efficiency Labels:**
- **B-C**: Relatively efficient homes with moderate energy consumption  
- **D**: Average energy consumption
- **E-F**: High energy consumption
- **G**: The least efficient with very high energy consumption (Settle Down Support, 2025)

### Energy Consumption Patterns

#### Electricity Usage
Average electricity consumption in Dutch homes has dropped from 3300 kWh per year to 2800 kWh per year (Energie Nederland, 2023). Per capita electricity consumption is 6,100 kWh, which is 10% above the EU average (Enerdata, n.d.). Electrical appliances use the majority of electricity in homes and have become consistently more efficient since 2000, especially after the introduction of the Ecodesign directive (ODYSSEE-MURE, n.d.).

#### Heating and Gas Consumption
Gas is by far the most important source of heat in the Netherlands, though its use is gradually declining (Energie Nederland, 2023). Household gas consumption has fallen from 1850 cubic meters per year to a little under 1300 cubic meters (Energie Nederland, 2023). The energy used for space heating per square meter in households has decreased steadily until 2015 due to better insulation and a grown share of high efficiency condensing boilers (ODYSSEE-MURE, n.d.).

### Energy Sources and Environmental Impact

#### Current Energy Mix
In 2024, the Netherlands' electricity mix includes 36% Gas, 27% Wind and 18% Solar, with low-carbon generation reaching a record high (Low Carbon Power, 2025). Electricity production from renewable sources increased to 32.3 billion kWh in the first half of 2024, with the share of renewable electricity at 53% of total electricity production (Chambers Global Practice Guides, 2024).

#### CO2 Emissions and Transition Goals
By 2050, the Netherlands wants to be using energy from sustainable sources only (Government.nl, n.d.). The country has targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 49% by 2030 and by 95% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels (IEA, 2020). Household CO2 emissions fluctuated between 20 and 25 billion kg per year from 1990 to 2015, but have since fallen below 20 billion kg (Energie Nederland, 2023).

### Impact on Property Values and Energy Costs
A property with label C on average sells for 12% more than one with label G (InExpatFin, 2023). 

**Important Note on Energy Prices:** Current average energy prices are approximately €0.32 per kWh for electricity and €1.39 per cubic meter for gas based on new variable energy contracts from major suppliers (Overstappen.nl, 2023). However, these prices vary significantly by supplier, contract type (fixed vs. variable), and region. Consumers should check current rates with specific suppliers for accurate pricing.

## Part 2: Heat Pumps, Solar Panels, and Electrification for Existing Buildings

### Heat Pumps for Existing Buildings

#### Targets and Milestones
The Dutch government aims for 1.5 million heat pumps in dwellings by 2030, targeting at least 1 million (hybrid) heat pumps to replace natural gas boilers in existing dwellings (HPT, 2025). The HR-Hybrid Coalition has urged the Dutch government to allocate €600 million for a plan to install at least 100,000 hybrid heat pumps in homes and buildings every year from 2024, envisaging deployment of up to 2 million hybrid heat pumps before 2030 (PV Magazine, 2021).

**Critical Update on 2026 Mandate:** The requirement for hybrid heat pumps to become mandatory when replacing central heating boilers from 2026 faces significant political uncertainty. The new coalition government has proposed abandoning this requirement, causing concern in the heat pump industry (European Heat Pump Association, 2024). The mandate also includes important exemptions:
- Homes that are technically unsuitable (insufficient insulation or lack of installation space)
- Properties that will soon be connected to a heating network
- Monumental properties with architectural restrictions
- Properties in apartment buildings where collective solutions may be more appropriate (Bricknest, n.d.)

For landlords, the requirement that homes with energy labels E, F, or G cannot be rented from 2030 remains in effect (Bricknest, n.d.).

#### Current Status
At the end of 2024, about 1 in 12 dwellings in the Netherlands were equipped with a heat pump, with 702,000 in residential and 50,000 in the utility sector (HPT, 2025). In 2023, more than 150,000 heat pump units were sold in the Netherlands, up 53% from 2022 levels (REN21, n.d.).

#### Financial Support
95% of homeowners can afford the costs of insulating to energy label B and installing an electric heat pump using either savings or loans (DNB, 2024). The subsidy (ISDE) in 2024 is around 20-30% of the investment for heat pumps with energy label A+ or higher. Note that subsidy rules are becoming stricter annually and amounts are subject to change (Settle Down Support, 2024).

### Solar Panels for Existing Buildings

#### Targets and Areas
By 2030, 70% of all Dutch electricity must come from renewable sources, including solar panels on roofs and in solar parks (Materia Rinnovabile, 2024). Solar capacity targets for 2030 include 59.3GW total solar capacity, with 20.8GW from large-scale solar farms (ABN AMRO Research, 2024).

Approximately 50% of all rooftops in the Netherlands could potentially host PV systems, representing around 725 km² of rooftops, though only 8% could immediately accommodate solar arrays without obstacle removal (PV Magazine, 2024).

#### Building Priorities
As of 1 July 2023, installation of solar PV on commercial rooftops became part of the Recognized Measures List of the energy-saving obligation (LinkedIn - Niekoop, 2023). Data from various sources indicates that approximately 60% of solar energy comes from panels installed on commercial structures, while the rest comes from residential buildings.

More than 50% of roofs in the Netherlands are too weak for traditional solar installations. RABLE developed a self-supporting mounting system that allows solar panels to be installed on almost all of these roofs without renovation costs (InnovationQuarter, 2023).

### Battery Storage Systems

#### Current Development
2023 saw a 260% increase in installed battery storage capacity in the Netherlands. 56% of the total batteries purchased (13,600 of 24,400) were small home batteries—less than 5 kWh—followed by bigger home batteries with up to 20 kWh capacity (Innovation Origins, 2024).

The Dutch government has allocated €100 million in subsidies for the deployment of battery storage alongside PV projects, with the scheme scheduled to open on Jan. 1, 2025, and end in 2034 (PV Magazine, 2024). Minister Rob Jetten has introduced a policy requiring the integration of battery energy storage systems at large-scale solar parks to address power grid overload (Ampowr, 2023).

#### Future Outlook
The forecast shows a total capacity of about 10.1 GWh by 2026, including commercial, residential, and utility installations, with 5.2 GWh in the residential sector (Innovation Origins, 2024).

### District Heating and Shared Heat Systems

#### Coverage and Requirements
In the Netherlands, some 500,000 homes are connected to district heating (Gasunie, n.d.). The government aims to connect a quarter of Dutch homes to heat networks by 2050 (Government.nl, n.d.).

Large scale high temperature heat networks typically have a temperature of 100-130°C and deliver heat to consumers at 90°C with return flow at 70°C (Energy.nl, 2024). Low temperature heat networks require dwellings with sufficient insulation, at least corresponding to energy label B, and LT-heating systems consisting of low temperature radiators or underfloor heating (Energy.nl, 2022).

#### Regional Suitability
Urban areas typically require less pipeline length per connected building than less densely populated areas (ETM, n.d.). District heating is less attractive for areas with low population densities, as the investment per household is considerably higher. It's also less attractive in areas of many small buildings like detached houses than in areas with fewer larger buildings (based on industry analysis).

### Retrofit Characteristics for Existing Buildings

#### Innovative Approaches
Energiesprong is coordinating a system of mass retrofits in the Netherlands. In Utrecht, houses and apartments retrofitted in 2019 have seen their energy use drop by around 78%. The retrofits use lightweight insulated panels that can be attached directly to old walls, happening in as little as a day (Energiesprong, n.d.).

#### Building Requirements for Heat Pumps
After upgrade to insulation level from current regulations, implementation of Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) reduces space heating demand by 50-65% while insulation upgrade to passive house standards yields an average heat demand reduction of only 15% (ScienceDirect, 2022).

## Part 3: Calculation Framework for Building Retrofits

### 1. Solar Potential Calculation

#### Basic Solar Output Formula
With a south-facing roof, you can generate 150 kWh per m² of solar electricity annually. The yield of a roof facing east or west is still 125 kWh per m² (Zonnepanelenplanet, 2022).

**Formula for Annual Solar Generation:**
```
Annual Solar Output (kWh) = Roof Area (m²) × Yield Factor × Orientation Factor × Location Factor
```

Where:
- **Yield Factor**: 150 kWh/m² for south-facing (Zonnepanelenplanet, 2022)
- **Orientation Factor**: 
  - South: 1.0
  - Southwest or Southeast: 0.90 (approximately 10% less energy) (HuisAssist, 2023)
  - East/West: 0.83 (125/150)
- **Location Factor** (Netherlands): Eastern NL: 0.82, Central NL: 0.90, Western NL: 0.97 (Zonnepanelenplanet, 2022)

**Note:** These are theoretical yields under optimal conditions. Actual output may be reduced by shading, soiling, system losses, and weather variations.

#### Panel Sizing Formula
In Belgium and the Netherlands, solar panels can operate at maximum capacity for approximately 850 to 900 hours per year (HuisAssist, 2023).

```
Required Panels = Annual Energy Need (kWh) / (Panel Wattage × 0.85)
Solar array output = electricity consumption / (365 × solar hours in a day)
```
(Omnicalculator, 2024)

### 2. Heat Pump Sizing Based on Building Characteristics

#### Heat Loss Calculation by Energy Label
Heat loss calculations based on building age and insulation level (HeatGeek, 2022):
- Victorian/pre-war with single glazing: 95-110 W/m²
- With double glazing, minimal insulation: 65-85 W/m²
- With good insulation: 40-65 W/m²
- Pre-2006 or recent renovations: 30-50 W/m²
- Recent newbuilds: 20-40 W/m²
- Low carbon homes: 10-20 W/m²

**Heat Pump Sizing Formula:**
```
Heating Load (W) = Area (m²) × Power Coefficient (W/m²)
Heat Pump Size (kW) = Building Area (m²) × Power Coefficient (W/m²) / 1000
```
(MyEngineeringTools, n.d.)

#### Energy Label Specific Values (Netherlands)
Based on energy consumption between labels (Homeup, n.d.):
- Label A++++: <50 kWh/m²/year → ~15 W/m²
- Label A+++: 50-75 kWh/m²/year → ~20 W/m²
- Label A++: 75-105 kWh/m²/year → ~30 W/m²
- Label A+: 75-105 kWh/m²/year → ~35 W/m²
- Label A: ~105 kWh/m²/year → ~40 W/m²
- Label B: ~50 W/m²
- Label C: ~60 W/m²
- Label D: ~75 W/m²
- Label E-G: ~90-110 W/m²

**Important:** These are estimates. Professional heat loss calculations should be performed for accurate sizing.

#### Annual Energy Consumption Formula
To work out approximate total annual kWh demand, multiply heat loss by 1,500 for heating and 500 for hot water (HeatGeek, 2022).

```
Annual Heating (kWh) = Heat Loss (kW) × 1,500
Annual Hot Water (kWh) = Heat Loss (kW) × 500
Total Annual (kWh) = Heat Loss (kW) × 2,000
```

### 3. Battery Storage Sizing

#### Basic Battery Sizing Formula
```
Battery storage capacity = (Total Daily Energy Consumption)/(DoD × Days of Autonomy)
```
(FranklinWH, n.d.)

Where:
- **Depth of Discharge (DoD)**:
  - Lead Acid: 0.5 (50%)
  - Lithium: 0.8-0.95 (80-95%)
- **Days of Autonomy**: Typically 1-3 days

#### Grid-Connected Battery Sizing
For grid-connected systems, consider export data: a house regularly exporting 8-10 kWh during the day and importing 8-10 kWh at night suggests a 10 kWh battery (EcoAffect, 2024).

```
Optimal Battery Size = Daily Export to Grid (kWh) OR Evening Import (kWh)
```

### 4. Retrofit Priorities by Building Type

#### Building Function Priorities:
1. **Commercial Buildings**: 
   - As of 1 July 2023, installation of solar PV on commercial rooftops became part of the energy-saving obligation (LinkedIn - Niekoop, 2023)
   - Office buildings must have minimum energy label C

2. **Residential Buildings**:
   - From 2030, homes with energy labels E, F, or G cannot be rented (subject to political changes) (Bricknest, n.d.)
   - Hybrid heat pump mandate from 2026 faces political uncertainty and includes significant exemptions (European Heat Pump Association, 2024)

#### Retrofit Impact by Energy Label Upgrade:
Implementation of Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) reduces space heating demand by 50-65% while insulation upgrade to passive house standards yields only 15% reduction (ScienceDirect, 2022).
