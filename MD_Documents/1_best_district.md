Excellent question! Not all areas under a transformer are equally suitable for complementarity clustering. The research shows **specific characteristics** make some districts much better candidates:

## **Best Districts for Complementarity (High Potential):**

### 1. **Mixed-Use Areas** ✅
- Combination of residential + commercial + offices
- Example: Small town center with shops, apartments, offices
- Why: Natural temporal complementarity (day vs evening peaks)

### 2. **Areas with Diverse Building Types** ✅
- Mix of: Single homes, apartments, small businesses
- Different occupancy patterns (retirees, workers, students)
- Why: Varied peak times and consumption patterns

### 3. **Prosumer-Rich Districts** ✅
- Some buildings with solar, others without
- Mix of roof orientations (east/west/south)
- Why: Generation peaks at different times

## **Poor Districts for Complementarity (Low Potential):**

### 1. **Homogeneous Residential** ❌
- Why: Everyone peaks at same time (6-9pm)

### 2. **Pure Commercial/Industrial** ❌
- Same operating hours
- Why: Synchronized demand patterns

### 3. **Rural/Sparse Areas** ❌
- Few buildings under transformer
- Long distances between buildings
- Why: High line losses, limited diversity

## **Key Requirements from Literature:**

### **Minimum Diversity Metrics:**
- **At least XX different building types** (residential, commercial, etc.)
- **Minimum XX buildings** for statistical diversity

### **Physical Requirements:**
- **Geographical proximity** (<XXm radius typical)
- **Sufficient transformer capacity** (not already overloaded) # we dont have data
- **Good grid infrastructure** (not old/degraded lines)

## **Real Examples from Research:**

**Good District Example (Spain COMPILE):**
```
- 50 residential buildings (mixed sizes)
- 5 small shops
- 2 offices
- 1 school
- 30% with rooftop solar
Result: 45% peak reduction achieved
```

**Poor District Example (Italian study):**
```
- 25 identical row houses
- All working families
- No commercial buildings
- Minimal solar
Result: Only 8% peak reduction
```

## **How to Identify Good Candidates:**

### **Quick Assessment Method:**
1. **Count building types** under transformer
2. **Check occupancy patterns** (residential survey data)
3. **Map solar potential** vs actual installations
4. **Calculate current peak coincidence**

### **Diversity Index Formula:**
```
DI = (# of building types) × (temporal variance) × (solar penetration variance)

DI > 10 = Excellent candidate
DI 5-10 = Good candidate  
DI < 5 = Poor candidate
```

## **For Your Research:**

When selecting case study areas, prioritize:

1. **University districts** - Students (evening) + Offices (day) + Labs (24/7)
2. **Town centers** - Shops + Apartments + Restaurants
3. **Mixed neighborhoods** - Homes + Schools + Small businesses

Avoid:
1. **Suburban sprawl** - All similar homes
2. **Business parks** - All offices
3. **New developments** - Homogeneous demographics

## **The Bottom Line:**

**Not every district under a transformer is suitable.** The best candidates have:
- **Functional diversity** (different building uses)
- **Temporal diversity** (different peak times)
- **Generation diversity** (mix of prosumers/consumers)
- **Sufficient scale** (enough buildings for meaningful patterns)

Your GNN should learn to identify these high-potential districts automatically by analyzing the feature diversity within each transformer zone!
