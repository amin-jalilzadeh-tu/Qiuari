# GNN

## A. GNN for Energy Systems & Clustering

Multilayer GNN for Predictive Maintenance and Clustering in Power Grids
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07298
Relevance: Uses hierarchical GNN for resilience-based substation clustering
Architecture: GAT (spatial) + GCN (temporal) + GIN (causal)
Your Added Value: You consider building-level complementarity, not just substation clustering

GGNet: A novel graph structure for power forecasting in renewable power plants
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261924005774
Relevance: Introduces dynamic graph structures using temporal granularity groups
Key Innovation: Dynamic adjacency matrix generation for temporal lead-lag correlations
Your Added Value: You focus on complementarity rather than just forecasting
