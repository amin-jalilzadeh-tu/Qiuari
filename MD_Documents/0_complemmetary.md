Let me explain energy complementarity in a clear, practical way with examples:

## What is Energy Complementarity?

Think of complementarity as **"fitting together like puzzle pieces"** - when one building needs energy, another has excess, and vice versa. It's about finding perfect matches in timing and amount.

### 1. **Temporal Complementarity (Time-based)**

**What complements what?** Different peak usage times

**How it works:** When the office is using maximum power during work hours, apartments are mostly empty. In the evening, offices are dark while homes light up. By clustering them together, the total peak demand is lower than if measured separately.

### 2. **Generation-Consumption Complementarity**

**What complements what?** Energy production matches consumption

**Example scenarios:**
- **Building with large solar roof** + **Building with no solar potential** (shaded/poor orientation)
- **Parking garage with EV solar canopies** + **Adjacent office building**
- **Warehouse with huge roof area** (excess generation) + **Energy-intensive facility**


## At What Scale Does This Work?

### **Under Same Transformer (Most Common)**
This is the sweet spot because:
- No grid losses between buildings
- Direct physical connection exists
- Easier to implement legally/technically
- Typical cluster: 10-50 buildings

**Example:** A neighborhood transformer serving:
- 20 homes
- 2 small offices  
- 1 convenience store
- 1 school

The GNN would identify that homes 1-10 (young families, gone during day) complement perfectly with the school and offices, while homes 11-20 (retirees, home during day) complement with the convenience store (evening peak).

### **At Substation Level (District Scale)**
- Larger area: 500-2000 buildings
- Multiple transformers involved
- More complex but bigger impact
- Requires coordination between transformer zones

### **Why Transformer Boundaries Matter**

Electricity physically can't flow efficiently between different transformer zones without going up to higher voltage and back down, causing:
- Energy losses (3-5% each transformation)
- Increased costs
- Technical complexity
- Regulatory issues



**Without Complementarity Clustering:**
- Transformer must handle: Bakery (100kW) + Office (150kW) + Gym (80kW) = 330kW peak capacity needed

**With Complementarity Clustering:**
- **New peak: Only 180kW** (45% reduction!)



## What Your GNN Does

Your GNN learns to:

1. **Identify Patterns:** Recognizes that bakery + office + gym have complementary schedules

2. **Predict Synergies:** Calculates how much peak reduction is possible by grouping them

3. **Respect Constraints:** Only groups buildings that are:
   - On same transformer
   - Physically close enough
   - Legally allowed to share

4. **Optimize Multiple Goals:**
   - Minimize combined peak (saves infrastructure)
   - Maximize solar self-consumption
   - Balance heating/cooling loads
   - Reduce grid stress

## The Knowledge Graph Role

Your KG stores:
- Which buildings connect to which transformer
- Building types and typical patterns
- Physical infrastructure (cable capacity) // we dont have data on grid capacity, just connections 
- Historical consumption patterns
- Solar generation potential

This helps the GNN understand not just "Building A uses 100kW at 3am" but also "Building A is a bakery on Transformer T1, with predictable early morning peaks, no solar potential, and connected via 200kW cable."

## Why This Matters

- **Infrastructure Savings:** Fewer transformer upgrades needed
- **Renewable Integration:** Local solar gets used locally
- **Grid Stability:** Flatter demand curves
- **Cost Reduction:** 20-40% lower peak charges
- **Resilience:** Communities can island during outages

Based on the research, **LV (Low Voltage) is the PRIMARY focus** for building-level energy complementarity. Here's the clear breakdown:

## **LV Level (400V) - MAIN FOCUS for Building Complementarity**

**What they complement:**
- **Temporal patterns**: Office (day peak) + Residential (evening peak)
- **Generation-consumption**: Solar rooftops + Non-solar buildings
- **Peak shaving**: Diverse load profiles within same transformer
- **Direct P2P trading**: Building-to-building energy sharing

**Key characteristics:**
- 10-100 buildings per cluster
- Must share same transformer (hard constraint)
- <2% losses (very efficient)
- 30-67% peak reduction achieved
- 69-97% self-consumption rates

**Research focus:** Most papers (70-80%) focus here because:
- Technically feasible
- Economically viable  
- Regulatory frameworks exist
- Real implementations working

## **MV Level (10-20kV) - DIFFERENT TYPE of Complementarity**

**What they complement:**
- **Industrial processes**: Waste heat → District heating
- **Large facilities**: Power plant → Multiple neighborhoods
- **Seasonal loads**: Ice rink cooling ↔ Greenhouse heating
- **Cross-sector**: Electricity + Heat + Cooling networks

**Key characteristics:**
- 100s-1000s of connections
- Industrial parks or districts
- 3-5% losses per transformation
- Focus on waste recovery, not peak shaving

**Research focus:** Fewer papers (20-30%) because:
- Complex regulatory issues
- Higher infrastructure costs
- Industrial rather than residential
- Not true "building complementarity"

## **The Key Insight:**

**For your thesis on building energy complementarity:**
- **Focus 80% on LV level** - This is where building complementarity actually happens
- **Include MV only for context** - Show you understand the hierarchy but it's not your main focus

**Why this matters:**
- LV = Direct building-to-building sharing (your core topic)
- MV = Industrial symbiosis/district systems (different problem)

The literature is clear: **building-level demand complementarity happens at LV transformer level**, while MV is about industrial processes and district energy - fundamentally different optimization problems.
