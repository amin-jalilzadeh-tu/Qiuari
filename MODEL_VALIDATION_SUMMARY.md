# GNN Model Validation & Tracking Summary

## Executive Summary

Your GNN model has been comprehensively tested against all specified requirements. Here's what we found:

### Overall Compliance: 73% ✅
**Status: PASSES basic requirements with some areas needing improvement**

## Validation Results by Category

### ✅ STRONG AREAS (100% Compliance)
- **Quality Assessment**: All cluster quality metrics and categorization working perfectly
- **Solar Capabilities**: ROI calculation, cascade modeling, and roadmap planning fully implemented
- **Learning Process**: Unsupervised discovery, pseudo-label generation, and iterative learning all functional
- **Explainability**: Human-readable explanations and feature importance analysis working well
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: MC Dropout with 20 iterations properly implemented

### ⚠️ AREAS NEEDING ATTENTION
1. **Architecture Issues** (Critical):
   - Model detected as not fully GNN compliant (needs investigation)
   - Only 1 message passing layer detected instead of required 3

2. **Constraint Violations** (Critical):
   - LV boundary constraint being violated (1 cluster crossing boundaries)
   - Some clusters violating size constraints (should be 3-20 buildings)

3. **Minor Issues**:
   - Temporal energy patterns only partially implemented
   - Cluster stability tracking not fully operational
   - Energy sharing constraint verification incomplete

## Penetration Rate & Roadmap Functionality

The system now includes comprehensive solar deployment planning:

### New Capabilities Added:
1. **Multi-year Roadmap Generation**
   - Define target penetration rate (e.g., 20%, 30%, 50%)
   - Set timeframe (e.g., 5 years, 7 years)
   - Choose optimization strategy:
     - Linear: Equal distribution across years
     - Accelerated: More installations in later years
     - Cascade-optimized: Prioritize high network impact
     - Cluster-balanced: Ensure even distribution across clusters

2. **Yearly Planning Features**
   - Building-specific installation targets
   - Capacity calculations per building
   - Investment requirements per year
   - Expected self-sufficiency evolution
   - Peak reduction estimates

3. **Cluster Evolution Tracking**
   - Predicts how clusters change with solar installations
   - Tracks stability metrics
   - Models energy flow changes
   - Visualizes temporal evolution

4. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Track actual vs planned installations
   - Check if on track for targets
   - Deviation analysis
   - Recommendations for course correction

## How to Use the System

### 1. Model Validation
```python
from validation.model_requirements_validator import ModelRequirementsValidator

# Initialize validator
validator = ModelRequirementsValidator(config)

# Run comprehensive validation
report = validator.validate_model(
    model=system.model,
    test_data=test_data,
    gnn_system=system
)

# Generate reports
validator.save_report("validation_report.json")
validator.generate_html_report("validation_report.html")
```

### 2. Generate Solar Roadmap
```python
# Generate 5-year roadmap for 30% penetration
roadmap = system.generate_solar_roadmap(
    target_penetration=0.3,  # 30%
    timeframe_years=5,
    strategy='cascade_optimized'
)

# Access yearly plans
for year_plan in roadmap.yearly_plans:
    print(f"Year {year_plan.year}:")
    print(f"  Buildings: {len(year_plan.target_installations)}")
    print(f"  Capacity: {year_plan.total_capacity_mw:.2f} MW")
    print(f"  Investment: €{year_plan.budget_required:,.0f}")
```

### 3. Track Progress
```python
# After year 1 installations
progress = system.track_roadmap_progress(
    completed_installations=[building_ids],
    years_elapsed=1.0
)

print(f"Progress: {progress['area']['percentage_complete']:.1f}%")
print(f"On track: {progress['area']['on_track']}")
```

## Key Metrics Tracked

### Model Performance
- **Cluster Quality**: Self-sufficiency, complementarity, peak reduction
- **Solar ROI**: 4-class categorization (excellent/good/fair/poor)
- **Energy Flows**: Who shares with whom, how much, when
- **Uncertainty**: Confidence intervals for all predictions

### Roadmap Metrics
- **Penetration Rate**: Current vs target, progress tracking
- **Investment**: Annual and cumulative costs
- **Capacity**: MW installed per year
- **Environmental**: CO2 reduction estimates
- **Grid Benefits**: Investment deferral, peak reduction

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority (Fix These First)
1. **Fix LV Boundary Violations**: Ensure clusters NEVER cross LV group boundaries
2. **Add More Message Passing Layers**: Current model only has 1, needs 3
3. **Enforce Cluster Size Limits**: Strictly maintain 3-20 building clusters

### Medium Priority
1. **Improve Cluster Stability**: Minimize buildings jumping between clusters
2. **Add Temporal Features**: Better weekday/weekend and seasonal patterns
3. **Verify Energy Sharing Constraints**: Ensure sharing only within LV groups

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Calibrate Confidence Scores**: Improve uncertainty calibration
2. **Enhance Cascade Modeling**: More sophisticated multi-hop impacts
3. **Add More Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for results

## Files Created

### Core Components
- `validation/model_requirements_validator.py` - Comprehensive validation system
