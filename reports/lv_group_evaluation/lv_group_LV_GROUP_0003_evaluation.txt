üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
  1. LIMITED complementarity - focus on individual optimizations
  2. URGENT: 62 buildings need immediate retrofit (E/F/G labels)
  3. HIGH solar potential: 97% roof area available
  4. Consider coordinated heat pump deployment program
  5. HIGH peak coincidence - demand response program recommended
  6. Transformer near capacity - prioritize load reduction
  7. GOOD mixed-use potential - consider coordinated demand response programs
  8. ‚ö†Ô∏è HOMOGENEOUS district - limited complementarity benefits, focus on individual building optimizations
  9. Consider expanding district boundaries to include more diverse building types
  10. RESIDENTIAL focus - prioritize comfort, solar, and peak shaving interventions
