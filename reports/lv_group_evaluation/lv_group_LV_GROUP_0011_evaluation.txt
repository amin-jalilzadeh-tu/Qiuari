üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
  1. LIMITED complementarity - focus on individual optimizations
  2. HIGH solar potential: 100% roof area available
  3. Consider coordinated heat pump deployment program
  4. HIGH peak coincidence - demand response program recommended
  5. Transformer underutilized - room for electrification
  6. HIGH solar potential - coordinated solar installation program recommended
  7. ‚ö†Ô∏è HOMOGENEOUS district - limited complementarity benefits, focus on individual building optimizations
  8. Consider expanding district boundaries to include more diverse building types
  9. HIGH solar readiness - bulk procurement and installation program recommended
  10. GOOD heat pump readiness - coordinate with retrofit and grid upgrade planning
  11. COMMERCIAL focus - prioritize demand response and grid services
