üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
  1. LIMITED complementarity - focus on individual optimizations
  2. HIGH solar potential: 90% roof area available
  3. Consider coordinated heat pump deployment program
  4. Transformer underutilized - room for electrification
  5. HIGH solar potential - coordinated solar installation program recommended
  6. ‚ö†Ô∏è HOMOGENEOUS district - limited complementarity benefits, focus on individual building optimizations
  7. Consider expanding district boundaries to include more diverse building types
  8. HIGH solar readiness - bulk procurement and installation program recommended
  9. COMMERCIAL focus - prioritize demand response and grid services
