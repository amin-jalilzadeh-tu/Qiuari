üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
  1. LIMITED complementarity - focus on individual optimizations
  2. HIGH solar potential: 100% roof area available
  3. HIGH peak coincidence - demand response program recommended
  4. Transformer underutilized - room for electrification
  5. ‚ö†Ô∏è HOMOGENEOUS district - limited complementarity benefits, focus on individual building optimizations
  6. Consider expanding district boundaries to include more diverse building types
  7. RESIDENTIAL focus - prioritize comfort, solar, and peak shaving interventions
