### **üìã DETAILED STEPS**

#### **Step 1: Initialize Neo4j Connection & Schema**
```
Purpose: Set up database structure
Process:
1.1 Connect to Neo4j instance
1.2 Clear existing data (if requested)
1.3 Create constraints:
    - Unique IDs for all node types
    - Index on frequently queried properties
1.4 Define node labels and relationship types
Output: Empty graph with schema ready
```

#### **Step 2: Load Grid Infrastructure Hierarchy**
```
Purpose: Create electrical network topology
Process:
2.1 Create Substation node:
    - Properties: id, location, capacity_mva
2.2 Create MV_Transformer nodes:
    - Properties: id, location, capacity_kva
    - Link to substation via FEEDS_FROM
2.3 Create LV_Network nodes:
    - Properties: component_id, location, capacity_kva
    - Link to MV transformers via FEEDS_FROM
2.4 Validate hierarchy completeness
Output: Complete grid topology graph
```

#### **Step 3: Load and Enhance Buildings**
```
Purpose: Create building nodes with derived features
Process:
3.1 Create Building nodes with raw attributes:
    - Static: ogc_fid, area, height, type, orientation
    - Location: x, y coordinates
3.2 Calculate derived features:
    - Energy label (from age + type)
    - Insulation quality (from age + label)
    - Solar potential (from roof + orientation)
    - Electrification feasibility
3.3 Assign to LV networks:
    - Create CONNECTED_TO relationships
    - Add distance_to_transformer property
3.4 Calculate network position metrics:
    - Buildings on same transformer
    - Electrical centrality
Output: 150 building nodes with 30+ properties each
```

#### **Step 4: Load Temporal Energy Data**
```
Purpose: Create time-series representation
Process:
4.1 Create TimeSlot nodes:
    - One per 15-min interval (672 total)
    - Properties: timestamp, hour, day_of_week, is_weekend
4.2 Create EnergyState nodes:
    - One per building per timeslot
    - Properties: demands (elec/heat/cool), generation, storage
4.3 Calculate state metrics:
    - Net demand (demand - generation)
    - Is surplus (generation > demand)
    - Export potential
4.4 Link states:
    - Building HAS_STATE_AT EnergyState
    - EnergyState DURING TimeSlot
4.5 Add temporal sequences:
    - EnergyState FOLLOWS next_EnergyState
Output: Complete temporal graph layer
```

#### **Step 5: Compute Complementarity Relationships**
```
Purpose: Identify synergistic building pairs
Process:
5.1 For each LV network:
    - Get all building pairs
5.2 Extract demand profiles:
    - 7-day sequences for each building
5.3 Calculate complementarity metrics:
    - Correlation coefficient
    - Peak time offset
    - Average anti-correlation strength
5.4 Create COMPLEMENTS relationships:
    - If correlation < -0.3
    - Properties: score, peak_offset, type
5.5 Identify sharing potential:
    - If spatial_distance < 200m
    - AND has complementarity
    - Create COULD_SHARE_WITH
Output: Network of complementary relationships
```

#### **Step 6: Identify Asset Opportunities**
```
Purpose: Mark deployment potential
Process:
6.1 Solar potential assessment:
    - If roof_area > 50m¬≤ AND good orientation
    - Create SolarSystem node (status: 'potential')
    - Link: Building CAN_INSTALL SolarSystem
    - Calculate: recommended_capacity_kwp
6.2 Battery readiness:
    - If has solar OR high evening demand
    - Create BatterySystem node
    - Calculate: recommended_capacity_kwh
6.3 Electrification priority:
    - If poor energy label AND gas heating
    - Mark SHOULD_ELECTRIFY
    - Estimate: expected_COP, upgrade_needed
Output: Asset opportunity nodes and relationships
```

#### **Step 7: Create Initial Clusters**
```
Purpose: Bootstrap clustering for GNN training
Process:
7.1 Simple complementarity clustering:
    - Group buildings with strong COMPLEMENTS edges
    - Respect LV network boundaries
7.2 Create EnergyCluster nodes:
    - Properties: cluster_id, lv_network_id
7.3 Calculate cluster metrics:
    - Member diversity (building types)
    - Baseline peak (sum of individuals)
    - Expected peak reduction
7.4 Create MEMBER_OF relationships:
    - Building to Cluster
    - Add confidence score
Output: 10-20 initial clusters for analysis
```

#### **Step 8: Add Metadata and Statistics**
```
Purpose: Store computed metrics for querying
Process:
8.1 LV Network statistics:
    - Total buildings, diversity index
    - Current peak load, available capacity
8.2 Building statistics:
    - Load factor, peak demand time
    - Complementarity degree (# of COMPLEMENTS)
8.3 System-wide metrics:
    - Total solar potential
    - Electrification candidates
    - Average complementarity score
8.4 Create MetaData node:
    - Creation timestamp
    - Data quality metrics
    - Configuration used
Output: Searchable statistics layer
```
